# Getting started
## For users:
Because NDTr is not in CRAN yet, you could either do `devtools::install_github("XInzhu-Fang/NDTr")`, which install NDTr from GitHub, or do `devtools::install_github(“r-lib/devtools”, ref = “7211ff8bff6d109fd1d9079080205306f4225ec8”)` so that the `Remotes` tag in `DESCRIPTION` is processed and the previous operation will be automatically done for you.
## For us:
We can also do `devtools::install_local("../NDTr")`
